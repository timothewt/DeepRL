# TODO: find a way to solve this DQN loss going to 0 using action masking
# TODO: add a CNN model
# TODO: multi agents DQN
# TODO: add mask with multi-discrete action space

# Env idea : tron-like game where agents need to reach a target while avoiding other agents' bike trails
#            agents can choose to steer far left, left, go straight, right or far right

# TODO : action masks sizes are a problem in multi discrete!!!!
# TODO : alternating policy; policy id stored in agent info; list of possible policies in the env init, ppo dict of policies in the algo init?
